<em>Segmentation model on Chest CT Scans with COVID-19</em>

This dataset contains anonymised human lung computed tomography (CT) scans with COVID-19 related findings, as well as
without such findings. A small subset of studies has been annotated with binary pixel masks depicting regions of interests
(ground-glass opacifications and consolidations). CT scans were obtained between 1st of March, 2020 and 25th of April, 2020,
and provided by medical hospitals in Moscow, Russia.
